# Game Of Corners â™Ÿ

## Introduction

This is a browser game which was made with **OOP approach** and which has a lot of interesting features to **improve** user experience. Try this app live on GitHub Pages [here](https://kr4chinin.github.io/game-of-corners-OOP/).

### Functionality

Below you can see a **pseudo-schema** which shows how classes and objects interact:

In this application i've implemented:

- Unit movement logic from scratch
- DnD functionality. Player can use **Drag & Drop mechanic** to move his units or he can manually select them and choose where to go by clicking on the preferred square
- Squares where user can go with selected unit are dynamically highlighted
- **Movements log** with timestamps at the sidebar and "whose turn now" indicator
- Modals with win messages and game rules, smooth animations

### View

When user enters the app **for the first time** he will see this message with game rules:

This is the **main screen** of the game:
